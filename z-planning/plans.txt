make a separate table for one time passwords? It would populate a randomized one 
time password (5 characters) in the table, then delete it once it has been used 
(user type it in and confirmed their account) ??

maybe instead I make another column in the users table that holds a one time password.
It would be populated in the database (hashed) by the backend, which would also send the 
one time password to your email. Server clears the column in the database when you use
the one time password.


can i add an email checker tool that determines if an email format is valid? 
ex. 'mason@gmail' is not valid


add more responsiveness to the sign up form. Maybe check marks and X's that appear as 
icons next to the inputs when the database query comes back 


add a list of requirements beneath each signUp input, and checks or x's by each one as 
they are passed or not






to fix!
- make it send a confirmation email on signup, not just when you click confirm
